# WHO-Life-Expectancy-Prediction-Model

Dataset taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who

This project analyses the different factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates. Firstly, feature engineering was performed to remove all null values in the dataset. Then a multi-linear regression model was used to predict the life expectancy of countries based off the selected features. An r2 score of 80% was achieved.
